I am an Indiana University Bloomington Alumnus who graduated in 2019. I received my B.S. in Informatics with a cognate in Criminal Justice, and minors in Criminal Justice, and Computer Science with a focus on security. At University my research focused on Bluetooth security, and the fingerprinting of users based off of passively sniffed data.

I am currently pursuing further training in topics related to cyber security, and have just started my career as a CyberSec professional. My interests lie at the intersection between technology, data, and the criminal justice system, and how these areas interact with one another.

On this site my words are my own and not reflective of my employer.

### Further Areas of Interest

I enjoy cooking, visual art, woodworking, and generally just working with my hands. Fitness is also core to my lifestyle and am in the grueling process of bulking, with the goal of being my strongest, healthiest me!
