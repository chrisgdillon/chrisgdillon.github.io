[The episode in question.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4m2reG3kza9bdRnquC7YQ0?si=EWGutM1hShKLhC_YE2gmow)
I had the honor of being brought in on [The Cyber Tap](https://open.spotify.com/show/4acm2NNMIbPb9HhtGQd0u5?si=MA-9aVofQJ660NUOGgdxJA) in late April by my instructors shortly after graduating from their Applied Cybersecurity Essentials program, to talk about my experiences in the post-pandemic, work from home world, and my experience in the transition. Along with some other students sharing their own experiences!
