## Overview
This first project is probably the largest in scope of all the ones actively being "worked on" as it is the consolidation of my work through University, grad classes, personal projects, etc. Moved to one spot, under one banner. Which is this website.

### Goals
  - Consolidate my project work from my old portfolio and professional website(s) under 1 umbrella.
  - Update, and display my updated resume.
  - Link to professional social media (LinkedIn, Github, etc.).
  - Create a space where I can maintain this site as a living document, with personal, professional and project updates, while sharpening my technical skills.
  - Maybe even shake the rust off of my graphic design skills and make some fun/sexy (can cards be sexy?) business cards, stay tuned.
  - And any other things that catch my attention.

### The Beginning
First up after creating, breaking, and then ultimately fixing the website and its structure (with some help from some gorgeous friends of mine), now it's time to toss in the first round of the series: Grad course work!

In College I enrolled in a grad course under the instruction of Prof. [Christian McKay](https://informatics.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?Christian_Mckay) (Director of the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering Makerspaces), which discussed the topics of fabrication and design, as well as prototyping. His course quickly became one of my favorite classes of my College career, as I could finally work in a shop with my hands. It just felt so right.

I'll split this course into posts from each week of that class rather than have one monster document, for both your sanity, and my own [:)](https://youtu.be/79DijItQXMM). One thing this class taught me was how to document processes while 'making.' Which is a real challenge in itself, to stop, think about what you're actually doing, and then take pictures and notes along the way, rather than an afterthought.

## Week 1: What's a Speaker?
The introductory project for Design & Fabrication was to build a rudimentary speaker, the design of which we will be refining over the course of the class.

### Materials:
  - Spool of wire
  - Plastic cup
  - Rod of some sort (PVC, wood, finger, etc.)
  - Wire cutters
  - Small magnets
  - Sandpaper
  - Hot glue, glue, or tape

### Instructions:

1. Cut a good length of wire, about 8-10in worth, and wrap the length of wire around the rod to create a coil.

2. Attach the coil of wire to the bottom of the plastic cup, dead center, and secure the coil with hot glue/tape.

3. Cut/tear off a bit of sandpaper, and remove the outer wire coating on the two ends of your wire coil. This is so that a clear electrical connection can be made.

4. Then, take your small magnets, connect each half on the center base of the cup. I found the easiest way to do this was by standing the cup on top of one half of the magnets, and then drop the other half inside, so that you let magnetism do the work for you.

5. Finally, connect the ends of wire to an adapter and plug into a device to hear the sweet quiet sound of your speaker!
