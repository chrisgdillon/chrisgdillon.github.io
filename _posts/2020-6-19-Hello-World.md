Is this thing on? If you're reading this then I have successfully set up the beginnings of the website, with blog functionality thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Here I will be posting updates about me, projects I am working on, and flushing out my portfolio. My goal with this is to help me in organizing my stuff, consolidate my work, and share what interests me, to the void.
