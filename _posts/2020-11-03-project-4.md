## Week 4: Pop-Up Speaker & Lazers
This week I managed to finish the pop-up speaker design from week 2, and tweaked my name tag design for the lazer cutter.

### Materials:
  - Computer
  - Drill Press
  - Band Saw
  - C02 Lazer Cutter
  - Autodesk Fusion 360 (CAD software)
  - Construction Paper
  - Magnet
  - Spool of Copper Wire
  - Scrap Wood ~1/4"
  - Masking Tape
  - Hot Glue Gun and Glue
  - Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop

## The Process
The gallery below shows the process of some lazer cutting, design drafting, and prototyping to the finished product. We used Fusion 360, Adobe Illustrator to draft the designs. First up, the speaker build.

My speaker did not build how I wanted it, with the supports (I chose to do three rather than just 2 in my blueprint, for greater stability) pushing more on one side causing the cone and coil to not be centered to the base. It still works, but it may be necessary to re-structure my supports to avoid this in the future.

Initial draft of the paper pop-up speaker:

Speaker base cut from blue construction paper, with rough area marked for where the supports to go:

Develop paper speaker supports from same paper as base, adding spring fold for "elastic" type support:

Cut out and prep speaker "cone" out of black construction paper; Also shown is the speaker coil that had been cut, rolled, and secured with masking tape:

Speaker coil glued to speaker cone, inside of the coil tube a small magnet is secured to the speaker base as well with hot glue:

Attaching the speaker front end to the base:

Now for the lazer cutting section of the week where I did a first pass at making a signature key chain:

Not shown is me cutting down the wood board into 2-3" squares for the class to use. Before I use the drill press to punch a hole for the "keychain."

The lines marked in red are seen and cut by the C02 lazer, and the design, like the material in the cutting workspace, has to be centered to the origin (top right) of the space:

The challenge with the lazer cut name tag focused more on the lazer cutter itself. I found that my first test was either too fast or needed another pass to clearly cut through the plank. I decided to slow it down, for a clearer cut which worked out. On my final piece I added a 3/16th sized hole cut with the lazer rather than use the drill press (like I initially did on my first draft), as well as cutting out the 5x5 board (rather than using the band saw, like on my first draft piece). This resulted in overall cleaner lines and cuts for a better end product.

The main purpose of this week was to gain more experience with the various shop tools, as well as continue with the development of the semester theme, speakers and sound. And, the gained experience on the equipment would aid in building out our foundation further.
