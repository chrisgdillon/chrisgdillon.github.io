##Week 3: A Break from Speaker Design
This week we worked more in depth with Fusion 360 (Our CAD of choice), drafting a few designs for various name plates, and tags. We also practiced crafting models for both types of 3D printers (resin and normal), and the laser cutter.

##The Process
The gallery below shows the process of 3D printing, from design drafting, to the finished product. We used Fusion 360, Adobe Illustrator and Cura to draft the designs.

Initial draft of a logo for printing use, something simple but with interest:

Beginning with Fusion 360 to draw up the plan,

then Illustrator (to prepare it for whatever process we're using) for tweaks,

and then finally Cura to prepare the file for the specific printer to be used (Ultimaker 2+ in this case).
