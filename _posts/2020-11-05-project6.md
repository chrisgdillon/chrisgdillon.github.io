## Week 6: Laptop Stand
This week we were tasked with creating a laptop stand. We began the draft by crafting the blueprint on Fusion 360, which allowed us to map out everything from finger joints to support braces, as well as adding cosmetic fillets for an overall better design. We learned how to add construction planes to make duplicating and mirroring objects easier, instead of doubling the amount of work necessary. After finishing the design I created 3 more sketches, labeled them top, leg, and support, and saved them as DXF and exported them to Illustrator. Using Illustrator I placed the DXF outlines onto one artboard, duplicating the necessary pieces, and marked the necessary cuts in red for the cutter (black for etching).

### Materials:
  - Computer
  - Autodesk Fusion 360 (CAD software)
  - Lazer Cutter
  - 1/4" wood board
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Band Saw

## The Process
Here are some views of my work in CAD drafting up the laptop stand.

Here I export the CAD view from Fusion 360 to a workable file in Adobe Illustrator, so that the lazer cutter can do its work:

Next, I marked the wood to cut it down to a more workable size on the band saw:

Finished cuts resting in the cutting bed.

Now begins the assembly process.

For me, the hardest part was the work with fusion, as I am more comfortable with Illustrator and wood working in general. The cutter went too fast and I had to make a second pass, which left less than a mm of material in some places, which I will need to sand off. I also had the idea of cutting out vent ports for my laptop which, sadly, vents on the bottom, and I plan on doing this using illustrator and just cutting into the top, and reassembling later. I will update that progress when I manage it.
