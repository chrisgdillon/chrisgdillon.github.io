## Week 5: Learning to Solder
First off, forgive the play acting, I forgot to get snapshots taken while I was soldering. Also, why's it spelled like that?

This week, after being trained on soldering, were tasked with making our adapters for our speakers (from wires to 3.5mm jack). Here we take the alligator clips, strip the ends to expose the wires, twist them each together, and do the same stripping to expose the adapter wires within the cord. Then simply solder a clip to the corresponding wire (here the clips are red and white, and the inner wires of the adapter were red and white, so I just had them match). Once you solder the wires, I taped them with electricians tape. If I had it available I would use some shrink tape or covers to then hide the work.

### Materials:
  - Wire
  - Solder
  - Soldering Iron
  - Wire Cutters/Strippers
  - Wire Grips
  - Alligator Clips
  - Sandpaper
