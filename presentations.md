#Writing/Presentations

Here is where you can find my writings that I have finished, and presentations that I have given or find useful or helpful, and you might too. Since I am both ***severely*** dyslexic and a predominantly visual learner, I have always found pictures to be much better at conveying information, and walls of text intimidating and convoluted. I hope you get something out of these!

###[Center for Internet Security Apple iOS 12 Security Benchmark](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qcumNSjvJxdsX3lB7g7JeZHhDcv4_R60Ju0IvAfyOUc/edit?usp=sharing)
A presentation I gave on the CIS Apple iOS 12 Security Benchmarks, this served as practice for briefing potential clients to improve awareness and security practices. As well as practice for reading security documentation.
